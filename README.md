This code is a Qiskit program that uses the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) or Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to trade options contracts while taking into account the activity of large buyers and institutions such as dark pools. The program first collects data for the specified option contract, including the last price, volume, momentum, implied volatility, dark pool volume, and dark pool routes. The program then trains a model on this data using either the VQC or QAOA algorithm, depending on the value of the USE_VQC flag. Finally, the program uses the trained model to make a prediction on the option data, and places a trade based on the prediction. If the prediction is above the threshold, the program will place a buy order for the option contract, and if the prediction is below the threshold, the program will place a sell order.
