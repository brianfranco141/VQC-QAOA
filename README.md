# VQC-QAOA
This program uses the Qiskit library to train a machine learning model on data for a specified options trading contract. It uses either the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) or Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to train the model, which are advanced algorithms that use quantum computing to make predictions.
