# VQC-QAOA
This program uses the Qiskit library to train a machine learning model on data for a specified options trading contract. It uses either the Variational Quantum Circuit (VQC) or Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) to train the model, which are advanced algorithms that use quantum computing to make predictions.

Once the model is trained, the program collects new data for the option contract and uses the trained model to make a prediction on that data. If the prediction is above a certain threshold, the program places a buy order for the option contract, and if the prediction is below the threshold, the program places a sell order. This allows the program to automatically execute trades based on the predicted profitability of the option contract.
